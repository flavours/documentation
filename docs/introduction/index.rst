The Flavours specification describes how web applications can be composed, configured and built, allowing vendor-neutral deployment across clouds.

What is Flavours?
=================

The Flavours specification aims to address the need for open and extensible application-level configuration.

Tools such as Docker, allow applications to be packaged into containers by abstracting the underlying infrastructure and describing an applications dependencies and middleware requirements. Existing container images of preconfigured software can be used to compose new containers and add features easily and efficiently. 

Containers can be deployed and run across different environments where environment variables provide specific environmental settings.

The Flavours specification extends this by describing the application details in vendor-neutral YAML (human-readable data-serialization language).
