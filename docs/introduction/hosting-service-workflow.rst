Hosting service workflow
#########################

A hosting service workflow will cover:

* project creation
* using Flavours tools to configure the project
* deployment on the hosting service

Links to documentation provided by hosting services that implement Flavours will be included here on request.

Divio
=====

`Divio <https://www.divio .com>`_ provides an implementation (currently in private beta) for Flavours support on its
hosting platform.

This *implementation* is distinct from the open Flavours *specification*, and just one possible way of providing
Flavours-aware hosting.
